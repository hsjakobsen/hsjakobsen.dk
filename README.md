# My personal website

My personal website attempts have always been defined by one of the following scenarios:
- Starting something too ambitious and never succeeding
- Setting up a wordpress website (my blog era) and then not maintaining it

The objective with this website is to try the following
- A super minimalistic website
- Built using SolidJS
- Try something super focused
